# English-Alphabet-Handwriting-Recognition-App
Description:
Welcome to the English Alphabet Handwriting Recognition GitHub repository! This project is a mobile application developed using Flutter, designed to recognize and analyze handwritten English alphabet characters. Whether you're looking to integrate handwriting recognition into your own Flutter app or simply interested in exploring the world of machine learning and handwriting analysis, this repository is a valuable resource.

Features:

Handwriting Recognition: The core feature of this app is its ability to recognize handwritten English alphabet characters accurately. Users can write individual letters on the screen, and the app will predict and display the recognized letter.

Machine Learning Model: The handwriting recognition is powered by a machine learning model trained on a substantial dataset of handwritten English alphabet samples. The model has been fine-tuned to deliver high accuracy in character recognition.

User-Friendly Interface: The app provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface for writing letters and receiving recognition results. It's suitable for both children learning to write and developers interested in the technology.

Interactive Learning: For educational purposes, the app offers interactive learning features, such as tracing letters and getting instant feedback on the user's writing.
